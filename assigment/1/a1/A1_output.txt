Summary
The model was trained for five epochs and achieves a validation negative log-likelihood of 4.6006 and a validation perplexity of 99.54. It demonstrates solid contextual understanding by correctly predicting "states" after "The president of the United" with high confidence, offers sensible geographical completions for location prompts, and produces grammatically plausible continuations for adjective–noun phrases. These results indicate the model has learned meaningful language patterns while still reflecting vocabulary limits for rarer proper nouns.
