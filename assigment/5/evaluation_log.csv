21645374,Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,2011,yes,"Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",21645374,yes,yes,21645374

The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.",17208539,yes,no,17208539
10808977,Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?,2000,yes,"The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography.

19054501,Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?,2009,yes,"Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.",19054501,yes,no,19054501

14612308,Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?,2003,no,"The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",14612308,yes,no,14612308

15597845,Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer?,2004,yes,2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.,15597845,yes,yes,15597845
24996865,Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery?,2015,yes,"As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.",24996865,yes,yes,24996865
23361217,Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?,2013,yes,"Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.",23361217,yes,yes,23361217

26449554,Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?,2016,yes,"In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.",26449554,yes,yes,26449554

9483814,Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?,1997,yes,Paracervical anaesthesia is a method for analgesia during second trimester abortion with a low rate of side effects. It can shorten the duration of last period of second trimester abortion in some cases but has no impact on the perception of pain nor requirement of analgesics and so with only limited benefit in second trimester abortion with vaginal gemeprost.,9483814,yes,no,9483814
22720085,Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk?,2012,yes,"The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.",22720085,yes,yes,22720085
24748473,Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity?,2014,yes,"The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.",24748473,yes,yes,24748473
15588538,Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome?,2004,no,"Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.",15588538,no,no,15588538
24433626,Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker?,2014,yes,Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.,24433626,yes,yes,24433626

8422202,Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach?,1993,no,"This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.",8422202,no,no,8422202
23794696,Does the bracket-ligature combination affect the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months?,2013,no,The hypothesis that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the rate of space closure was not supported.

26452334,Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?,2016,yes,"Due to a relatively good reproducibility, fast and easy application, we found the linear dimension method to be the most pragmatic approach for evaluation of growth of carotid and vagal body paragangliomas. For jugulotympanic tumours, the preferred method is manual area tracing. However, volumetric changes of these tumours may be of less clinical importance than changes in relation to surrounding anatomical structures.",26452334,no,yes,26452334
15065192,Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?,2004,yes,"3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB.

This ""crêpe-paper"" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.",12612531,yes,yes,12612531
26194560,Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,2015,yes,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",26194560,yes,yes,26194560

24747511,Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit?,2014,yes,"The results indicate that difficulties removing irrelevant material from working memory might be unique to depression, and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is relatively preserved in social anxiety disorder.",24747511,yes,no,24747511
19836806,Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index?,2009,no,"Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.",19836806,no,yes,19836806
21801416,The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?,2011,yes,"Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.",21801416,yes,yes,21801416
25819796,Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read?,2015,yes,"When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.",25819796,yes,yes,25819796
18496363,Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible?,2008,no,The independent protective effect of female gender on multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences after injury.,18496363,no,no,18496363
14551704,Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?,2003,yes,The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.,14551704,yes,yes,14551704
23234860,Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival?,2013,no,Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.,23234860,yes,yes,23234860
22532370,Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?,,yes,"Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.",22532370,yes,yes,22532370
22656647,Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced?,2012,yes,"High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.",22656647,yes,no,22656647
22683044,Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles?,2013,yes,"Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.",22683044,yes,yes,22683044
11566686,In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?,2001,yes,"Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.",11566686,yes,no,11566686
15502995,Does the early adopter of drugs exist?,2004,no,"Within drug groups, indicators of drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.",15502995,yes,yes,15502995
24019262,Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?,2014,yes,"Results for low back pain are consistent with the theory of hypertension-associated hypalgesia, predicting diminished pain sensitivity with increasing blood pressure, possibly with modified reactions in people suffering from long-lasting pain.",24019262,no,no,24019262
23348330,Nasal fractures:  is closed reduction satisfying?,2013,yes,"Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.",23348330,yes,yes,23348330
21658267,"Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival?",2011,yes,"Our findings support the importance of increasing access to clinical services, certain outreach services and breastfeeding and, in Africa, of improving nutritional status. Integrated programs that emphasize these services may lead to substantial mortality declines.",21658267,yes,yes,21658267
28177278,Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?,2017,yes,This case illustrates the importance of considering PAN in the differential diagnosis of renal infarction with inflammatory syndrome and shows that spontaneous remission of renal PAN can occur. .,28177278,yes,no,28177278
20363841,Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers?,2010,no,"COPD is underdiagnosed in the United States. Symptoms are frequent in subjects with AO and increase their risk for COPD, but add little beyond age and smoking history to the predictive value of spirometry. In view of the high prevalence of symptoms and their poor predictive value, a simpler and more effective approach would be to screen older smokers.",20363841,yes,yes,20363841
19664156,Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful?,2009,yes,This Google-based search was useful to identify an appropriate diagnosis in complex immunological and allergic cases. Computing skills may help to get better results.,19664156,yes,yes,19664156
23356465,Uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice?,2013,yes,This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.,23356465,no,no,26516021
22972546,Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness?,2012,no,This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.,22972546,no,yes,22972546
21850494,Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?,2012,yes,"We report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that early treatment might increase survival.",21850494,yes,yes,21850494
20187289,Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice?,2010,no,"When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease.",20187289,no,no,20187289
20297950,Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome?,2010,yes,The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome.,20297950,yes,yes,20297950
23735520,Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness?,2013,yes,"The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term ""functional minimally conscious state"" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.",23735520,yes,yes,23735520
10759659,The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?,2000,yes,A UNP can be trained to perform cystoscopy and detect suspicious lesions as accurately as can a consultant urologist. Legal and training issues in implementation are important.,10759659,yes,yes,10759659
25592625,Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas?,2015,no,Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.,25592625,yes,yes,25592625
12595848,Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure?,2003,yes,We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.,12595848,yes,yes,12595848
20064872,Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset?,2010,yes,A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.,20064872,no,no,27991408
23588461,Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?,,yes,"A greater association than hitherto acknowledged, between ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements from one side, and long-term rehospitalization and mortality from the other, was demonstrated in male stable alcoholic cirrhotics. Further studies with alcoholic and other modalities of cirrhosis including women are recommended.",23588461,yes,yes,23588461
18019905,The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just a difference between the rich and the poor?,2007,no,"Differences in maternal mortality are more than just differences between the rich and poor. Acknowledging the magnitude of maternal mortality and harnessing a strong political will to tackle the issues are important factors. However, there is no single, general solution to reduce maternal mortality, and identification of problems needs to be promoted through audit, both national and local.",18019905,no,no,18019905
25859857,Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer?,2015,no,"The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.",25859857,no,yes,25859857
26418796,Do Wound Cultures Give Information About the Microbiology of Blood Cultures in Severe Burn Patients?,2016,yes,"When there is clinical suspicion of sepsis, appropriate empirical systemic antibiotic therapy should be broad spectrum and should rely on the susceptibility of the organisms from recent cultures of the burn wound surface, until the blood cultures results are completed.",26418796,yes,no,26418796
22825590,Are behavioural risk factors to be blamed for the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans?,2012,yes,"During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.",22825590,yes,yes,22825590
18832500,Systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring: is it helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry?,2008,yes,"The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.",18832500,yes,yes,18832500
18955431,Treadmill training post stroke: are there any secondary benefits?,,yes,"A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.",18955431,yes,yes,18955431
9550200,Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?,1998,yes,"In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.",9550200,yes,yes,9550200
10135926,Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?,1994,yes,Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 helicopter.,10135926,yes,yes,10135926
24139705,Telemedicine and type 1 diabetes: is technology per se sufficient to improve glycaemic control?,2014,yes,"The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.",24139705,yes,no,24139705
16253970,Is controlled ovarian stimulation in intrauterine insemination an acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple pregnancies?,2006,no,"In COS-IUI for unexplained non-conception, induction of more than one follicle did not improve the ongoing PR, but increased the risk of multiple pregnancies. Multiple PR remained high in the first four cycles with multifollicular stimulation. Therefore, in order to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies, in all IUI cycles for unexplained non-conception monofollicular growth should be aimed at.",16253970,yes,yes,16253970
14745753,Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis?,2004,yes,Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.,14745753,yes,yes,14745753
27078715,Digital Tomosynthesis: A Viable Alternative to Noncontrast Computed Tomography for the Follow-Up of Nephrolithiasis?,2016,yes,"We found DT to be a comparable imaging modality to NCCT for the detection of intrarenal stones, without a significant effect from stone size and BMI and adequate reproducibility between multiple readers. DT appears to be an ideal alternative for following patients with nephrolithiasis due to its acceptable stone detection rates, low radiation exposure, and decreased cost compared to NCCT.",27078715,yes,yes,27078715
15939071,High cumulative insulin exposure: a risk factor of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes?,2005,yes,These findings provide evidence that a high cumulative dose of regular insulin is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.,15939071,yes,yes,15939071
11926574,Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?,2002,no,"In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.",11926574,yes,yes,11926574
18594195,Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate?,2008,yes,"As in many studies, the refusal rate in this study is high, and seems to be related to physical mobility restrictions, travel distance and, partly, to availability of emotional support. These findings may be used to make the recruitment process more effective - for example, by offering transport to the location of the intervention.",18594195,yes,yes,18594195
25614468,Preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging?,2016,no,"Our prospective study confirmed the leading role of EUS and MDCT in the staging of gastric cancer and did not prove, at present, the value of the clinical use of MRI.",25614468,yes,yes,25614468
19653482,Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup?,2009,yes,Transactive memory theory extends to high-stress environments in which members' expertise is highly overlapping. Teammates' shared mental models about one another increase the likelihood that they will request and accept backup.,19653482,yes,yes,19653482
11380492,Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?,2001,yes,"Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.",11380492,yes,yes,11380492
16296668,Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke?,1998,no,"Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and outcome needs to be studied.",16296668,no,yes,16296668
19520213,Are UK radiologists satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse?,2009,no,"The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.",19520213,no,no,19520213
19931500,Can the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer?,2009,yes,The preliminary results of this study suggest that this approach may be helpful as an independent tumor staging factor. It is also worth noting that part of the staging process could also be based on features describing the immune cells in the peripheral blood.,19931500,no,yes,27554179
18378554,Are wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation equivalent?,2008,no,"Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.",18378554,yes,no,18378554
17306983,Is size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement an option in modern aortic surgery?,2007,yes,"As demonstrated in this study, size reduction of the ascending aorta using aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a safe procedure with excellent long-term results. It is a therapeutic option in modern aortic surgery in patients with poststenotic dilatation of the aorta without impairment of the sinotubular junction of the aortic valve and root.",17306983,yes,yes,17306983
26879871,Does depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location?,2016,yes,"New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.",26879871,yes,no,23497210

17704864,Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm?,2008,yes,"LA for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm is a safe and feasible technique, offering successful outcome in terms of intraoperative and postoperative morbidity, hospital stay and cosmesis for patients; it seems to replicate open surgical oncological principles demonstrating similar outcomes as survival rate and recurrence rate, when adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated. The main contraindication for this approach is the evidence, radiologically and intraoperatively, of local infiltration of periadrenal tissue.",17704864,yes,yes,17704864
18307476,Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce disability in the elderly?,2008,yes,"Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.",18307476,yes,yes,18307476
15151701,Profiling quality of care: Is there a role for peer review?,2004,yes,"For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.",15151701,yes,yes,15151701
26399179,Eyelid-parotid metastasis: do we screen for coexisting masses?,2015,yes,"These cases illustrate that tumours involving eyelids and parotid glands can present simultaneously or sequentially, and either of these structures could be the focus of primary or metastatic tumour. The important message for oculoplastic and parotid surgeons is to routinely assess both the periocular and parotid area when patients present with a mass in either structure.",26399179,yes,yes,26399179
21889895,Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure?,2011,no,"Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to them.",21889895,yes,yes,21889895
21569408,Does context matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality?,2011,no,The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.,21569408,yes,yes,21569408
23025584,Does stress increase imitation of drinking behavior?,2013,no,"Generally, it appears that among young male adults, imitation of alcohol consumption is a robust phenomenon not dependent on individual stress levels.",23025584,no,yes,23025584
23587089,School food policy at Dutch primary schools: room for improvement?,2013,yes,"Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.",23587089,yes,yes,23587089
15539888,Is the atopy patch test with house dust mites specific for atopic dermatitis?,2004,yes,These observations lead to conclude that the APT with HDM is positive also in non-AD subjects but it is probably more specific for AD.,15539888,yes,no,15539888
23096188,Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?,2012,yes,"MRI of children with OCD consistently showed secondary physis disruption, overlying chondroepiphysial widening, and subchondral bone edema.

10381996,Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease: is it accurate enough?,1999,no,"ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.",10381996,yes,no,10381996
25274085,Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?,2014,no,"Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.",25274085,yes,yes,25274085
12098035,Does a special interest in laparoscopy affect the treatment of acute cholecystitis?,2002,yes,"Patients with AC are more likely to undergo successful LC if cared for by a surgeon with an interest in laparoscopy. However, length of hospital stay is influenced more by patient factors in a multivariate model.",12098035,yes,yes,12098035
12963175,Can progression of valvar aortic stenosis be predicted accurately?,2003,yes,The present data indicate that for clinical purposes and planning of valvar surgery the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification.,12963175,yes,no,12963175

14631523,Sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma: is it clinically meaningful?,2003,no,"Discordant observations due to interobserver variability make histological sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children insufficient for predicting prognosis and biological behaviour. Similar survival rates in a population of paediatric low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas of grades I and II indicate that tumour grade has no prognostic significance within this group of patients. ""Surgically gross-total removal"", especially if the tumour is located in the fourth ventricle is of the highest importance for long-term survival. Histological sub-classification of the tumours has no predictive value.",14631523,no,yes,14631523
26717802,After CLASS--Is a voluntary public insurance program a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities?,2016,no,"While more than a quarter of the middle-aged adult population said they were interested in PAS insurance, actual participation would be highly dependent on premium rates. The current lack of publicly subsidized insurance for long-term care and personal assistance services remains a serious gap in the disability service system.",26717802,no,yes,26717802
23810330,Is intraoperative neuromonitoring associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME?,2013,yes,In this study TME with IONM was associated with significant lower rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction.

9003088,Immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal. Implications for anal incontinence?,1996,yes,Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.,9003088,yes,no,9003088
23337545,Is acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia the expression of immune dysregulation?,2013,yes,"Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome.

10593212,Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion?,1999,no,The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.,10593212,no,yes,10593212
24519615,Does patella position influence ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty?,2015,yes,"The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.",24519615,yes,yes,24519615

21074975,Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis?,2011,yes,"Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the ""early"" versus ""late"" prodrome model. It also indicates that particular clinical attention may need to be paid to BLIPS patients, especially early in the course of treatment.",21074975,yes,yes,21074975

12690589,Can continuous physical training counteract aging effect on myoelectric fatigue?,2003,yes,It appears possible that aging skeletal muscles subjected to continuous exercise develop an adaptive response that counteracts the selective loss of type II muscle fibers usually observed in the muscles of elderly sedentary subjects. Our results suggest that physical activity could be considered in the elderly within a broad rehabilitative framework in which appropriate and even tailored physical training could be planned to counteract the physiologic effects of aging on muscle fiber distribution.,12690589,yes,yes,12690589
10757151,Does ischemic preconditioning require reperfusion before index ischemia?,2000,no,"The preconditioning effect (infarct size reduction) appears not to depend on intermittent reperfusion. Thus, the protective mechanism of IP develops during the initial ischemia that precedes the index ischemia.

10877371,Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome?,2000,yes,"In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as facing down while reading warrants further study.",10877371,yes,yes,10877371

12913347,Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland?,,yes,"The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.",12913347,yes,no,12913347
24684514,Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?,2014,no,"Not all the patients undergoing TKA who receive tranexamic acid need the same preoperative Hb optimization target.

20813740,Does β-catenin have a role in pathogenesis of sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid?,2011,yes,"Cytoplasmic overexpression of β-catenin was observed in the majority of the cases of SbCC of eyelid, and this correlated significantly with tumour size. The authors therefore hypothesise that β-catenin overexpression in SbCC of eyelid may be a result of Wnt/β-catenin pathway dysregulation. However, its role both in the development of sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid as well as its prognosis needs to be explored further.",20813740,yes,yes,20813740
20401819,Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?,2010,yes,"Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation.

10473855,Is delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy related to pylorus preservation?,1999,no,"DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.",10473855,yes,no,10473855

After 4 years, the 15.56 percent cumulative deflation rate of Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was over 3.5 times higher than the 4.31 percent deflation rate of the Mentor Siltex implants. There may be several factors contributing to the higher deflation rate seen in Poly Implant Prosthesis implants, including possible in vitro deflation before implantation and silicone shell curing technique. Nevertheless, this statistically significant deflation difference must be taken into account when balancing the risks and benefits of Poly Implant Prosthesis breast implants.",16772913,yes,no,16772913

This experience suggests that routine surgical implantation of segmental vessels is not indicated, and that, with evolving understanding of spinal cord perfusion, endovascular repair of the entire thoracic aorta should ultimately be possible without spinal cord injury.",17062225,no,no,17062225
14713788,Is year of radical prostatectomy a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer?,2004,yes,"When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis.

10577397,Is a pressor necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest?,1999,yes,The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.,10577397,yes,yes,10577397

23449952,Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of hand and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: do we really need a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine for assessing synovial enhancement at 3 T?,2013,no,"Postcontrast synovial SIs showed high correlation between half dose and full dose, and image quality was rated identically. Therefore, half-dose gadobenate dimeglumine at 3-T MR imaging may be sufficient for assessing synovitis or tenosynovitis in early RA.",23449952,no,no,23449952
10430303,Does laparoscopic cholecystectomy influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity?,,yes,"Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.",10430303,no,no,22970993
20605051,Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery?,2010,yes,This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals.,20605051,yes,no,20605051
23048048,Risky sexual behavior among college students With ADHD: is the mother-child relationship protective?,2015,yes,"Results suggest that female college students with ADHD are at risk for unprotected sex.

Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the ""test and treat"" policy.",28196511,yes,no,28196511
21431987,Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT?,2011,no,"PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.",21431987,yes,yes,21431987

11713724,Cancer of the buccal mucosa: are margins and T-stage accurate predictors of local control?,,no,Local excision of T1 and T2 buccal mucosa cancers with pathologically negative margins had a high rate of local recurrence in our series. Low T-stage and negative margins are not adequate predictors of local control. Even early buccal tumors may benefit from adjuvant therapy to enhance local control.,11713724,yes,no,11713724
25070942,Can mass drug administration lead to the sustainable control of schistosomiasis?,2015,no,"MDA on its own was insufficient to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of Schistosoma infection, or morbidity of the disease.

26304701,Can nurse-led preoperative education reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery?,2016,yes,"Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.",26304701,yes,yes,26304701
19058191,Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,2009,yes,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",19058191,yes,yes,19058191
27549226,Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries?,2016,yes,There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the national level.

In addition, a 2-lobe technique can be safely used for trilobar prostates when deemed feasible by the surgeon.",23453079,yes,yes,23453079
15053041,Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension?,2004,no,Aortic stiffness was not affected by acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol which suggests that it is not necessary to consider acute changes in HR when measuring aortic PWV.,15053041,yes,no,15053041
9465206,"""Occult"" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",1997,yes,"After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",9465206,yes,yes,9465206
19593710,Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?,2009,yes,"Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.",19593710,yes,yes,19593710

26999038,Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?,2016,yes,"In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.",26999038,yes,yes,26999038
