问题: I want to learn digital circuit design and FPGA. Which courses should I take?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
回答:
To learn digital circuit design and FPGA at Chalmers, here are some highly relevant courses based on your interest:

*   **EDA234 - Digital System Design Project**
    *   **Credits:** 7.5
    *   **Schedule Block:** C+
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/EDA234/?acYear=2025%2F2026
    *   **Description:** This is a project-oriented course focused on developing, implementing, testing, and evaluating hardware architectures for complex digital systems. It provides practical knowledge and skills in using programmable digital integrated circuits (FPGA and CPLD).
    *   **Prerequisites:** Fundamentals of Digital Systems and Computer Engineering, Electronics, and Computer Software Programming. It is recommended to have taken EDA322 Digital Design or SSY011 Electronic systems as a prerequisite.

*   **EDA322 - Digital Design**
    *   **Credits:** 7.5
    *   **Schedule Block:** I don't have enough information to provide the exact schedule block for EDA322 from the provided context, as the field is garbled.
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/EDA322/?acYear=2025%2F2026
    *   **Description:** This course offers fundamental knowledge in the analysis, synthesis, and optimization of combinatorial and sequential digital circuits. It introduces modern computer-based design tools (CAD) and the basics of hardware description languages (VHDL), including using FPGA technology for hardware design.
    *   **Prerequisites:** A preparatory course in Fundamentals of digital systems and computers.

*   **SSY011 - Electronic systems**
    *   **Credits:** 7.5
    *   **Schedule Block:** I don't have enough information to provide the exact schedule block for SSY011 from the provided context, as the field is garbled.
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/SSY011/?acYear=2025%2F2026
    *   **Description:** This course provides knowledge about methods and tools for analysis and design of analog and digital electronics, including VHDL code simulation and synthesis in an FPGA circuit, and state diagram design.
    *   **Prerequisites:** Knowledge corresponding to LEU470 Electrical Circuits, SEE035 Electricity and Electronics, and LEU432 Introduction to Computer Engineering.

*   **DAT480 - Reconfigurable Computing**
    *   **Credits:** 7.5
    *   **Schedule Block:** B
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/DAT480/?acYear=2025%2F2026
    *   **Description:** This course introduces reconfigurable computing, offering both theoretical and practical experience with reconfigurable technology, including advanced topics in architectures, design tools, and methods, and the use of FPGA technology.
    *   **Prerequisites:** Mathematics (including Calculus and Linear algebra), Programming in a general-purpose language (e.g., C/C++/Java/Haskell or similar), Introduction to Computer Engineering, and one of: Discrete mathematics, Mathematical statistics, Probability theory, Algorithms, or Data structures.

**Can these courses be taken together?**

*   **EDA234 (Block C+)** and **DAT480 (Block B)** can be taken together as they are in different schedule blocks.
*   For **EDA322** and **SSY011**, the schedule block information is not clearly provided in the context, so I cannot determine if they have time conflicts with other courses or each other.
*   Keep in mind that EDA322 or SSY011 are recommended prerequisites for EDA234, so you might consider taking one of those before or concurrently with EDA234 if your schedule allows.

I recommend checking the official Chalmers course website for the most up-to-date schedule information for EDA322 and SSY011.

测试 4/5: 课程对比 (EDA234 vs MCC093)
================================================================================
问题: Compare EDA234 and MCC093. Which one focuses more on hands-on projects?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ 找到课程 EDA234: 5 chunks
✓ 找到课程 MCC093: 5 chunks
回答:
Based on the provided context:

*   **EDA234 (Digital project laboratory)**: This course is explicitly described as a "project-oriented course" where students "develop a hardware architecture which is subsequently implemented, tested, and evaluated." The "project work is performed in groups of three or four students" over "a period of six weeks," culminating in a "written report" and a "seminar." This indicates a strong focus on extensive, hands-on projects.

*   **MCC093 (Introduction to integrated circuit design)**: This course includes "hands-on laboratory exercises using electronic design automation (EDA) tools" and "circuit design-tasks." While these are hands-on elements, they are described as laboratory exercises and tasks rather than a single, comprehensive project like in EDA234.

Therefore, **EDA234 (Digital project laboratory)** focuses more on hands-on projects.

Here's a summary:

*   **EDA234 - Digital project laboratory**
    *   **Focus:** Strongly project-oriented, involving groups of students developing, implementing, testing, and evaluating a complex digital system over six weeks.
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/EDA234/?acYear=2025%2F2026
    *   **Credits:** 7.5

*   **MCC093 - Introduction to integrated circuit design**
    *   **Focus:** Includes hands-on laboratory exercises and circuit design tasks using EDA tools, but is not described as a large-scale project course.
    *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/MCC093/?acYear=2025%2F2026
