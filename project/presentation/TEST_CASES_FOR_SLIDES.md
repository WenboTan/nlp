## Test Case 1: AI/ML Course Recommendation

### 👤 Student Question:
> "I want to specialize in machine learning and deep learning. What courses should I take and in what order?"

### 🤖 System Response:
✅ **Course Recommendations:**

• **DAT340 (Applied Machine Learning)** - Foundational course
  - Covers ML fundamentals, classical algorithms
  
• **TDA234 (Deep Learning)** - Advanced follow-up
  - Focuses on neural networks and deep learning techniques
  
• **DAT565 (Data Science and AI)** - Broader AI concepts
  - Comprehensive AI and data science coverage

📋 **Prerequisites:** 
  - DAT340 requires programming and statistics background

🔗 Full course URLs and prerequisite chains provided

## Test Case 2: Schedule Conflict Detection

### 👤 Student Question:
> "Can I take DAT565 (Data Science and AI) and MVE137 (Probability and Statistics) in the same period? Check their schedule blocks."

### 🤖 System Response:
📅 **Schedule Analysis:**

• **DAT565:** Block C (7.5 credits, English)
• **MVE137:** Block A (15 credits, full semester)

⚠️ **Conclusion: POTENTIAL CONFLICT!**
MVE137 runs the entire semester and overlaps with Block C

📋 **Additional Info:**
  - DAT565 prerequisites: Programming experience required

💡 **Recommendation:** Consider taking these courses in different semesters

## Test Case 3: Course Comparison & Analysis

### 👤 Student Question:
> "Compare DAT340 (Applied Machine Learning) and TDA234 (Deep Learning). Which one focuses more on hands-on projects?"

### 🤖 System Response:
📊 **Course Comparison:**

**DAT340 (Applied Machine Learning):**
• Balanced approach with practical assignments
• Covers classical ML algorithms (SVM, decision trees, etc.)
• Assessment: Project + Exam
• Focus: Broader ML applications

**TDA234 (Deep Learning):**
• More theory-heavy approach
• Focuses on neural network architectures
• Assessment: Primarily exam-based with coding assignments
• Focus: Specialized deep learning techniques

✅ **Conclusion:** DAT340 offers more hands-on project experience

## Test Case 4: Data Science Learning Path

### 👤 Student Question:
> "I'm interested in becoming a data scientist and want to work on real-world data projects. Recommend me a course sequence."

### 🤖 System Response:
🎓 **3-Phase Learning Path:**

**Phase 1 - Foundation:**
• MVE137 (Probability and Statistics)
• TDA540 (Programming fundamentals)

**Phase 2 - Core Skills (Choose):**
• DAT340 (Applied Machine Learning)
• DAT565 (Data Science and AI)
• MVE441 (Statistical Learning for Big Data)

**Phase 3 - Specialization (Choose):**
• TDA234 (Deep Learning)
• DAT450 (Data Mining and Visualization)
• **DAT290 (15 credits!)** - Complete data science project

⚠️ **Schedule Note:** DAT340 and MVE441 both in Block C - cannot take together

## Test Case 5: Honest Limitation Handling

### 👤 Student Question:
> "What is TDA567 (Testing and Debugging) about? Tell me the learning outcomes, prerequisites, and assessment methods."

### 🤖 System Response:
⚠️ **Limited Information Available:**

I don't have enough detailed information about TDA567's specific learning outcomes in the provided context.

✅ **What I can confirm:**
• Course is about software testing and debugging techniques
• Part of software engineering curriculum

🔗 **For complete details:**
Please check the official Chalmers University website for:
  - Detailed learning outcomes
  - Specific prerequisites
  - Assessment methods
  - Course schedule

💡 **Why this is good:** System honestly admits lack of information instead of hallucinating details - this builds trust!
