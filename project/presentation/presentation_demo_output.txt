        *   **Schedule Block:** Information for the schedule block is not clearly available in the provided context.

2.  **Project-Oriented Digital System Design:**
    *   **EDA234**
        *   **Credits:** 7.5
        *   **Prerequisites:** Fundamentals of Digital Systems and Computer Engineering, Electronics, and Computer Software Programming. It *recommends* EDA322 Digital Design or SSY011 Electronic systems as prerequisites.
        *   **Focus:** This is a project-oriented course where students design, implement, test, and evaluate a complex digital system, including using FPGA and ASIC technology platforms.
        *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/EDA234/?acYear=2025%2F2026
        *   **Schedule Block:** C+

        *   **Focus:** Introduces the field of Reconfigurable Computing, covering theoretical trends and practical experience with reconfigurable technology, including advanced topics in architectures, programming paradigms, and design tools.
        *   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/DAT480/?acYear=2025%2F2026
        *   **Schedule Block:** B

### Recommended Order and Schedule Considerations:

*   **Step 1 (Foundation):** Start with either **EDA322** or **SSY011** to build a strong foundation in digital design and basic FPGA concepts. The schedule block for these courses is not explicitly stated in the provided context, so you would need to check the official course schedule for availability.
*   **Step 2 (Practical Application):** After completing one of the foundational courses, take **EDA234** to gain practical, project-based experience in digital system design using FPGAs.
    *   **Schedule Block:** C+
*   **Step 3 (Advanced Topics):** For a deeper understanding of reconfigurable computing and advanced FPGA topics, **DAT480** would be the next logical step.
    *   **Schedule Block:** B

**Schedule Conflict Detection:**
Since EDA234 is in "Block C+" and DAT480 is in "Block B", there is **no direct time conflict** between these two courses, meaning you could potentially take them in the same study period if your foundational courses are already completed.

**Important Note:** The schedule block information for SSY011 and EDA322 was not clearly readable in the provided context. Please verify the current course schedules on the official Chalmers website for the most up-to-date information regarding these courses and their availability.

💡 演示重点: 多课程比较分析
================================================================================

❓ Question:
What's the difference between EDA234 and MCC093? Which one is more project-based?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ 找到课程 EDA234: 5 chunks
✓ 找到课程 MCC093: 5 chunks
💬 Answer:
Here's a comparison between EDA234 and MCC093 based on the provided context:

**EDA234: Digital project laboratory**
*   **Course Code:** EDA234
*   **Title:** Digital project laboratory
*   **Credits:** 7.5
*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Schedule Block:** C+
*   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/EDA234/?acYear=2025%2F2026
*   **Prerequisites:** Fundamentals of Digital Systems and Computer Engineering, Electronics, and Computer Software Programming. It is recommended to have taken EDA322 Digital Design or SSY011 Electronic systems.
*   **Description:** This is a project-oriented course where student groups develop, implement, test, and evaluate a relatively complex digital system over a six-week period. It focuses on practical knowledge and familiarization with CAD/EDA tools.
*   **Examination:** Continuous assessment including laboratory exercises, weekly meetings, log book examination, assessment of the final product and report, and an oral presentation. The grade is based on the project group's performance and individual contributions.

**MCC093: Introduction to integrated circuit design**
*   **Course Code:** MCC093
*   **Title:** Introduction to integrated circuit design
*   **Credits:** 7.5
*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Schedule Block:** The schedule block information for MCC093 is not clearly provided in the context (it appears as a long string of page properties).
*   **URL:** https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/find-course-and-programme-syllabi/course-syllabus/MCC093/?acYear=2025%2F2026
*   **Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge about electric circuit theory, analog and digital electronics, logic design, and computer organization, along with the ability to perform engineering calculations.
*   **Description:** This course introduces students to CMOS integrated circuit design and provides introductory training in industrial Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. It covers circuit design flow, MOSFETs, static and dynamic properties of CMOS inverters, logic gates, critical path delays, basic layout, adders, interconnect, wire delay, latches, flip-flops, and power consumption.
*   **Examination:** Consists of compulsory laboratory exercises, compulsory weekly home assignment hand-in problems, and a final written examination. 50% of the points in the written examination are required to pass.

---

**Differences and Project-based Nature:**

*   **Focus:**
    *   **EDA234** is explicitly a "project-oriented course" centered around developing and implementing a complete digital system.
    *   **MCC093** is an "introduction" to integrated circuit design, focusing on theoretical concepts and "introductory training" in EDA tools, with practical lab exercises supporting the learning.
*   **Examination:**
    *   **EDA234** has continuous assessment heavily weighted towards the project, including a final product and report.
    *   **MCC093** includes compulsory lab exercises and assignments, but also has a significant "final written examination" component (50% to pass).

**Which one is more project-based?**

Based on the descriptions, **EDA234: Digital project laboratory** is clearly more project-based. Its entire structure and examination revolve around a substantial group project to design and implement a digital system. MCC093 has practical, hands-on elements with EDA tools and labs, but it's framed as an introduction and training, with a traditional written exam playing a key role in grading.
